//Written by Reese Spaulding
// Modified by David Monsen to take the parameter of UserStats stats so that one variable is used in Main
// also modified class to call methods from UserStats instead of duplicating code
// added in random_roll variable to the method enemyAttack so that random is called each time that the method is called
